# hello-world
Hello People,

My name is Dennis Haig, I stay in Pretoria, South Africa and I am a IT Technician. In my spare time I try to write batch files to help me with my daily work. I am extremely interested in learning new things and have recently started to self study HTML. My goal is to create an internal support site for me and my colleagues to help us with our daily tasks.
